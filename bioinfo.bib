<p>Most traits of economic and evolutionary interest vary quantitatively and have multiple genes affecting their expression. Dissecting the genetic basis of such traits is crucial for the improvement of crops and management of diseases. Here, we develop a new resource to identify genes underlying such quantitative traits in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, a genetic model organism in plants. We show that using a large population of inbred lines derived from intercrossing 19 parents, we can localize the genes underlying quantitative traits better than with existing methods. Using these lines, we were able to replicate the identification of previously known genes that affect developmental traits in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and identify some new ones. This paper also presents all the necessary biological and computational material necessary for the scientific community to use these lines in their own research. Our results suggest that the use of lines derived from a multiparent advanced generation inter-cross (MAGIC lines) should be very useful in other organisms.</p>

abstract ={High-resolution mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) in
 animals has proved to be difficult because the large effect sizes
 detected in crosses between inbred strains are often caused by numerous
 linked QTLs, each of small effect. In a study of fearfulness in mice,
 we have shown it is possible to fine map small-effect QTLs in a
 genetically heterogeneous stock (HS). This strategy is a powerful
 general method of fine mapping QTLs, provided QTLs detected in crosses
 between inbred strains that formed the HS can be reliably detected in
 the HS. We show here that single-marker association analysis identifies
 only two of five QTLs expected to be segregating in the HS and
 apparently limits the strategy's usefulness for fine mapping. We solve
 this problem with a multipoint analysis that assigns the probability
 that an allele descends from each progenitor in the HS. The analysis
 does not use pedigrees but instead requires information about the HS
 founder haplotypes. With this method we mapped all three previously
 undetected loci [chromosome (Chr.) 1 logP 4.9, Chr. 10 logP 6.0, Chr.
 15 logP 4.0]. We show that the reason for the failure of single-marker
 association to detect QTLs is its inability to distinguish opposing
 phenotypic effects when they occur on the same marker allele. We have
 developed a robust method of fine mapping QTLs in genetically
 heterogeneous animals and suggest it is now cost effective to undertake
 genomewide high-resolution analysis of complex traits in parallel on
 the same set of mice.},

ABSTRACT = {Many plant pathogens show interactions with host development. Pathogens may modify plant development according to their nutritional demands. Conversely, plant development influences pathogen growth. Biotrophic pathogens often delay senescence to keep host cells alive, and resistance is achieved by senescence-like processes in the host. Necrotrophic pathogens promote senescence in the host, and preventing early senescence is a resistance strategy of plants. For hemibiotrophic pathogens both patterns may apply. Most signaling pathways are involved in both developmental and defense reactions. Increasing knowledge about the molecular components allows to distinguish signaling branches,  cross-talk and regulatory nodes that may influence the outcome of an infection. In this review, recent reports on major molecular players and their role in senescence and in pathogen response are reviewed. Examples of pathosystems with strong developmental implications illustrate the molecular basis of selected control strategies. A study of gene expression in the interaction between the hemibiotrophic vascular pathogen Verticillium longisporum and its cruciferous hosts shows processes that are fine-tuned to counteract early senescence and to achieve resistance. The complexity of the processes involved reflects the complex genetic control of quantitative disease resistance, and understanding the relationship between disease, development and resistance will support resistance breeding.},

abstract="Tan spot, caused by an ascomycete fungus Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, is one of the most devastating foliar diseases of wheat. This fungus induces two distinct symptoms, tan necrosis and extensive chlorosis, on susceptible wheat cultivars. Besides causing average yield losses of 5--10\%, tan spot also causes significant losses in grain quality by grain shriveling, red smudge, and black point. Conservation agriculture in combination with wheat monoculture involving cultivation of susceptible cultivars has resulted in frequent onset of tan spot epidemics worldwide. Development of new resistant wheat cultivars, in conjunction with crop rotation, will provide an effective, economical, and environmentally safe means of controlling tan spot. Presently, eight races of P. tritici-repentis have been identified worldwide based on the ability to induce necrosis and chlorosis symptoms on a set of differential wheat cultivars. P. tritici-repentis is a homothallic fungus having both sexual and asexual reproduction resulting in high genetic diversity worldwide. Both quantitative and qualitative mode of inheritance for resistance to tan spot of wheat has been reported. The tan spot fungus produces multiple host-specific toxins and host resistance is highly correlated to insensitivity to toxins. Genetic studies have further confirmed that wheat--P. tritici-repentis follows the toxin model of gene-for-gene hypothesis although other mechanism of host--pathogen interaction may exist and exploitation of all resistance phenomenon is to be adopted to develop durable resistant cultivars.",

abstract ={Cereals including wheat and barley are of primary importance to ensure food security for the 21st century. A combination of lab- and field-based approaches has led to a considerably improved understanding of the importance of organ and particularly of whole-plant (monocarpic) senescence for wheat and barley yield and quality. A delicate balance between senescence timing, grain nutrient content, nutrient-use efficiency, and yield needs to be considered to (further) improve cereal varieties for a given environment and end use. The recent characterization of the Gpc-1 (NAM-1) genes in wheat and barley demonstrates the interdependence of these traits. Lines or varieties with functional Gpc-1 genes demonstrate earlier senescence and enhanced grain protein and micronutrient content but, depending on the environment, somewhat reduced yields. A major effort is needed to dissect regulatory networks centred on additional wheat and barley transcription factors and signalling pathways influencing the senescence process. Similarly, while important molecular details of nutrient (particularly nitrogen) remobilization from senescing organs to developing grains have been identified, important knowledge gaps remain. The genes coding for the major proteases involved in senescence-associated plastidial protein degradation are largely unknown. Membrane transport proteins involved in the different transport steps occurring between senescing organ (such as leaf mesophyll) cells and protein bodies in the endosperm of developing grains remain to be identified or further characterized. Existing data suggest that an improved understanding of all these steps will reveal additional, important targets for continued cereal improvement.},

abstract ={MAGIC populations represent one of a new generation of crop genetic mapping resources combining high genetic recombination and diversity. We describe the creation and validation of an eight-parent MAGIC population consisting of 1091 F7 lines of winter-sown wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Analyses based on genotypes from a 90,000-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array find the population to be well-suited as a platform for fine-mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) and gene isolation. Patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) show the population to be highly recombined; genetic marker diversity among the founders was 74\% of that captured in a larger set of 64 wheat varieties, and 54\% of SNPs segregating among the 64 lines also segregated among the eight founder lines. In contrast, a commonly used reference bi-parental population had only 54\% of the diversity of the 64 varieties with 27\% of SNPs segregating. We demonstrate the potential of this MAGIC resource by identifying a highly diagnostic marker for the morphological character "awn presence/absence" and independently validate it in an association-mapping panel. These analyses show this large, diverse, and highly recombined MAGIC population to be a powerful resource for the genetic dissection of target traits in wheat, and it is well-placed to efficiently exploit ongoing advances in phenomics and genomics.

  abstract = {The explosion of knowledge about the basic biological processes and the genetics of cancer has led to increasing optimism that this knowledge can be put to practical clinical use in the near future. Indeed, important examples of translational approaches can already be found in the areas of drug discovery and development, disease diagnosis and classification, selection of therapeutic regimens for individual patients, and designing clinical trials. These are important developments but, as with any new approach, there is a danger of unwarranted enthusiasm and premature clinical application of laboratory results based on insufficient evidence. To carry out the translation of knowledge into practice with maximal efficiency and effectiveness, it is essential to conduct studies with appropriate designs and analyses based on sound statistical principles. This article provides an overview of some of these principles applied to assay development, validation of predictive models, and the design of clinical trials for targeted therapies.
